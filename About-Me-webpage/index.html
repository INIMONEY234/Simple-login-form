            <h3>Hello, my name is <mark>Iniobong Okon Uya</mark>.</h3><hr style="border: solid rgb(127, 141, 216) 2px;"><br>
            <p>I am a <mark>Front-End Developer</mark>, currently based in Port Harcourt, Rivers State Nigeria.</p><br> <hr style="border: solid rgb(127, 141, 216) 2px;"><br><br>
            <p>I am passionate about creating clean, responsive, and engaging websites that people love to use. <br><br>I enjoy bringing ideas to life with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks — making sure every project looks great and runs smoothly on any device.</p><br><br>
            <!-- Hobbies -->
            <p>For my <strong>hobbies</strong>, I will say outside coding, I am a bit of an explorer at heart. I love reading, traveling, taking photos, and teaching others — especially when it comes to new ICT tools and gadgets. <br><br>I am fascinated by how technology connects people and improves the way we live and learn. </p><br><br>
            <!-- Interests -->
            <p>I know at this point you are wondering, what exactly are my <strong>interests</strong>. <br><br>I will say take a sip of water and read along. You want to know what my interests are, right? . <br><br> Well, when I am not working on web projects, I am usually diving into topics like politics, human relationships, psychology, personal finance, and philosophy — basically anything that helps me understand people and the world a little better.</p><br><br>
